This project aims to investigate the impact of vaccines on the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic. The primary research question addresses whether vaccination has played a significant role in controlling new COVID-19 cases and deaths in countries across different continents. To explore this, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, followed by hypothesis testing using bootstrapping, permutation tests, ANOVA, and t-tests. The analysis reveals a complex relationship between vaccination and new confirmed cases, where the number of new cases increases as the number of daily administered vaccinations rises in regions such as the U.S., Europe, and Asia. This challenges the common belief that vaccination directly reduces case numbers. In Africa, vaccination seems to have reduced the number of new cases, but this trend may be caused by the problem with data completeness. In addition, when examining daily new deaths, vaccination appears to have a diminishing effect on deaths across all continents except Asia, which suggests that other important factors, such as government policies, may also influence the effect of vaccination. Overall, this study highlights the nuanced role of vaccination in the pandemic and suggests that its effectiveness may vary depending on complex interactions such as human behavior, new variants, the readiness of healthcare systems, and demographics.
